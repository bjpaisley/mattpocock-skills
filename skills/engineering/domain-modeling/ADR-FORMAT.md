# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily: only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why*, not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`): useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options**: only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences**: only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it: you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The design database is the single source of truth; generated RTL is never hand-edited."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Parsing and Connecting communicate through the design database, never by passing source text."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Parser library, template engine, simulator, register-map format, deployment target. Not every library: just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Port directions are owned by Parsing; Connecting references them and never re-infers them." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We render Verilog through templates instead of an AST emitter because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite. These stop the next engineer from "fixing" something that was deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "The flow must run on the farm's qualified tool versions." "Generated RTL must lint clean under the sign-off ruleset."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered SystemVerilog interfaces and picked flat ports for subtle reasons, record it; otherwise someone will suggest interfaces again in six months.
